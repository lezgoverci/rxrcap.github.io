                    <span style="font-weight: bold;">(Shah Alam, Malaysia) (May 11, 2020):</span> Private investment fund, RxR Capital Pte Ltd, in collaboration with the Selangor State Health Department, is launching the Bed Management Unit (BMU) Web platform in a bid to streamline information flow of healthcare assets and increase efficiency in fighting the COVID-19 pandemic. This initiative is part of corporate social responsibility (CSR) to overcome the difficulty of collecting and consolidating data.
        
                  </p>
               <p>
                RxR Capital, a privately-held investment fund and start-up accelerator owned by venture capitalist and entrepreneur Rina Neoh, has developed the platform to be used by the public hospitals in the state with estimated value of MYR 100,000. Neoh will team up with Deputy Director (Medical Division) of the Selangor State Health Department, Dr Faizal bin Mat Arifin to launch BMU Web, with the pilot hospitals in Selangor.
                
               </p>
                <p>
                    BMU Web is an online-based data consolidation platform developed by RxR Capital, which speeds up the process of hospital data collection, and allows for more responsive integration of information of different hospital assets. BMU Web uses a secure, authorised personnel-only platform, and will enable hospital staff to automate data collection, which is crucial to the fight against COVID-19.
                
                </p>
                <p>
                    The platform also reduces the probability of human error and automates several processes hosted at a local state server. This enables the state to act in a quick and data-driven manner that will be agile in its response to the outbreak.

                    Currently, there are 6,726 cases of COVID-19 infections in Malaysia, with 109 fatalities. A majority of the cases were detected in Selangor with 1,607 cases.
                
                 </p>
                <p>
                    Neoh, an experienced investor, and a native of Penang currently based in Singapore, said,* “Selangor has been hardest-hit, and it is crucial that our frontline staff are equipped to best deal with the outbreak. We  developed BMU Web in the hopes of easing up the workload of medical staff so they can focus more their energy in caring for their patients. This initiative is aligned with my mission as technology entrepreneur to harness technology in the service of humanity and the common good.” 
                
                </p>
                <p>
                    Meanwhile, Dr Faizal said, “We hope that this platform could make the data collection and reporting more efficient and speed up our decision on resource allocation during the pandemic. We also hope that this platform could continue to help in our public hospital bed management after the pandemic is over.”
